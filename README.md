# Dart API client sample

This is a (very) simple API client sample in Dart.

Create a new token in the [Span dashboard](https://span.lab5e.com) and launch the sample with `dart run bin/collections.dart [API token]`

## Adding the dependency

Add the dependecy to your project by running the following command: 
```bash
dart pub add spanapi --git-url https://github.com/lab5e/dart-spanapi
```
